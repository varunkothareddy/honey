<h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 13, 2025</p>

<p>Thank you for choosing Attmia Natural Honey. As we deal in perishable food products, our return and refund policy is designed to ensure hygiene, safety, and quality while complying with Indian food regulations.</p>

<h2>General Policy</h2>
<p>Honey is a consumable food item, therefore we have a strict no-return and no-refund policy for reasons such as change of mind, natural crystallization (which is normal and does not affect quality), or personal preference.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Damaged packaging or leaked/sealed-broken product upon delivery.</li>
    <li>Wrong product delivered (different from your order).</li>
    <li>Expired or adulterated product (though we guarantee freshness).</li>
</ul>
<p>In these rare cases, we will offer a replacement or full refund at our discretion.</p>

    <li>Do not consume or open the product further.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replacement products will be delivered within <b>7 days</b></p>
<h2>Process Timeline</h2>

    <li>Return shipping (if required) is paid by us only if the error is ours.</li>
